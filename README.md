# vibe-cli

A CLI tool/wrapper around [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) that supercharges your decentralised application workflow.

vibe-cli allows you to easily manage and orchestrate forked chain environments, test and compile smart-contracts, deploy and verify smart-contracts across various chains. It also allows you to easily test your contracts, and interact with your contracts using scripts.

> [!NOTE]
> vibe-cli is currently a work in progress. Expect missing features and bugs.
